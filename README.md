A battle-slain warrior, the Valkyries have ferried your soul to Valheim, the tenth Norse world. Besieged by creatures of chaos and ancient enemies of the gods, you are the newest custodian of the primordial purgatory, tasked with slaying Odinâ€™s ancient rivals and bringing order to Valheim.

# How to use

1. Open Pterodactyl Panel > Go to Nests > Import Egg > Import egg-valheim_umod.json > Done!
2. When you install a server and choose the port, you must release the next port also, example: 2456 and 2457

# How to Auto Update
